The "webscraping" directory contains a scrapy framework that was used to scrape the website SeekingAlpha.com.

The webscraping_seekingalpha.py fille contains a selenium script that was also used to scrape the site and retrieve URLs.

The jupyter notebooks were then used to clean the data and calculate returns for the final analysis.
